                        sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage
                        doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a
                        document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
                        assigned to that particular tab.

                        if you're specifically checking for undefined, that should be fine. by undefined, if you include
                        an empty string, 0, null, etc. then that won't catch those.

                        Just to nit-pick, objects don't have a value, they have properties. What you mean is that you
                        have a variable that may reference an object, or it might be undefined

                        In computer science, the event loop is a programming construct or design pattern that waits for
                        and dispatches events or messages in a program. The event loop works by making a request to some
                        internal or external "event provider" (that generally blocks the request until an event has
                        arrived), then calls the relevant event handler ("dispatches the event"). The event loop is also
                        sometimes referred to as the message dispatcher, message loop, message pump, or run loop.
                        The event-loop may be used in conjunction with a reactor, if the event provider follows the file
                        interface, which can be selected or 'polled' (the Unix system call, not actual polling). The
                        event loop almost always operates asynchronously with the message originator.
                        When the event loop forms the central control flow construct of a program, as it often does, it
                        may be termed the main loop or main event loop. This title is appropriate, because such an event
                        loop is at the highest level of control within the program.
